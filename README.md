# Pacman AI Agent
An Artificial Intelligent Agent that plays Pacman

## Description

The purpose of this work is to develop an agent capable of playing in a clever way the Pacman game, an arcade game that has become popular in the last century.

Several agents competed for the highest score when exposed to other agents (the ghosts) implemented by professor [Diogo Gomes](https://github.com/dgomes) and other contributors.

Our Pacman was the **winner agent of 2018**.
